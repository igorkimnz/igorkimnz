Hello, 

I am a BI Developer based in Auckland, New Zealand.

I specialize in delivering end-to-end data solutions, transforming raw information into meaningful insights. From gathering requirements to data modeling and visualization, I ensure every step adds value.

My strengths lie in data analysis and visualization, with <strong> Power BI </strong> being my tool of choice. That said, I'm no stranger to data modeling and enjoy crafting efficient, scalable solutions that drive informed decision-making.

Welcome to my page.
